          When faced to raise prices or decrease quality, Half Moon Seafood Co.
          was born to challenge the seafood status quo. Founded in 2020, the
          Half Moon team is committed to providing our guests with quality
          seafood in an affordable, fast-casual format.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take pride in our relationships with our suppliers to ensure we
          only serve seafood from transparent and sustainable sources. The Half
          Moon team is committed to providing a thoughtfully sourced meal,
          always made-to-order for you. Our goal is simple, to serve quality
          (and delicious) fish sandwiches, made with as few ingredients as
          possible.{" "}

          When it comes to great food, we donâ€™t think you should have to choose
          between fast and healthy. Half Moon Seafood Co. found a home in Tampa
          Bay, and we could not be more excited to join the community. Half
          Moon...full belly.
